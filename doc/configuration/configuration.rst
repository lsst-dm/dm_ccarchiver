CCArchiver Configuration
#######################

Note: The CC Archiver is currently a ConfigurableCSC but will change to a 
BasicCSC in the future.

The ts_salobj configuration for this CSC is always set to "normal" on START.
It has no real configuration parameters at this level. Most of the configuration
is static, not SAL facing, and is set in a YAML file that is loaded by the CSC.

The CCArchiver is configured using a YAML file. It is loaded from 
$IIP_CONFIG_DIR/ccarchiver_config.yaml. The $IIP_CONFIG_DIR is set on the 
command line which starts the container.

Our configuration method allows the re-use of the Archiver code between the 
ATArchiver, CCArchiver, and CatchupArchiver.  We do not hard code constant 
values (queue names, hostnames, etc) into the source code, and instead, set 
those values in the YAML file. On initialization, these values are set in the 
CSC. We can vary which service hosts we use, change machines, and change 
message exchange queues without having to change the source code. We can
consolidate most of the work in the main engine, and vary what we need to in 
specialized subclasses and message callbacks.

The following required entries are in the YAML file:
